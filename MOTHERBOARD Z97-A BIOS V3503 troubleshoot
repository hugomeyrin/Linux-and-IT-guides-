MOTHERBOARD Z97-A BIOS V3503

LINUX ISSUES ON CSM MODE OVERRIDES CONFIGURATIONS to default 

In know you've read this, but have you considered its possibilities?

PK Management
The Platform Key (PK) locks and secures the firmware from any permissible changes.
The system verifies the PK before your system enters the OS.
Delete PK
This item allows you to delete the PK from your system. Once the PK is deleted,
all the systemâ€™s Secure Boot keys will not be active.
Configuration options: [Yes] [No]
Load PK from File
This item allows you to load the downloaded PK from a USB storage device.

What you need to know for peace of mind is - what else if anything does the PK affect?
If nothing, then why not download the PK to a stick just in case you ever need it, then kill it?

Perhaps someone reading this can answer the question I underlined.

It seems you can do the same with all the other security gizmos, read to the end of page 2-54

On a quite different tack, I know that some members of this forum install LM and a bootloader partition to an external device and put that top of the boot priority list. Who needs grub when the only OS on the system boots without it?
I could imagine that an OS on a USB stick would slow down certain operations, but how about an external SSD?
Just trying to think outside the box to help you get a return on the investment in your new machine. Again, perhaps someone here could give you the benefit of their experience in this regard.
