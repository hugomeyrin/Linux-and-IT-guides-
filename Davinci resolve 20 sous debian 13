Davinci resolve debian 13


Run the installer from the terminal:

# make it executable
chmod +x ./DaVinci_Resolve_19.1.3_Linux.run
./DaVinci_Resolve_19.1.3_Linux.run 

I see these errors:

Error: Missing or outdated system packages detected.

Please install the following missing packages:
    libapr1 libaprutil1 libasound2 libglib2.0-0

Use SKIP_PACKAGE_CHECK=1 to bypass the system package check.

***********************
Installation cancelled.

So I do as they say:

sudo apt install libapr1 libaprutil1 libasound2t64 libglib2.0-0

Then re-run the installer:

export SKIP_PACKAGE_CHECK=1
./DaVinci_Resolve_19.1.3_Linux.run
