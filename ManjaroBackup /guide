~/backup-config.sh

Usecase
you own and use computer A with your configuration
you now bought another computer B which you will install with Manjaro
you would like to apply the same configuration on computer B as you have on computer A
in this context configuration is the files and folders found in
$HOME
/home/$USER
On computer A
ONLY user configuration is supported

Run the script using a shell

bash backup-config.sh $HOME/backup
The script creates three (3) files in the directory you specify - e.g. an USB stick

a list of repo packages
a list of custom packages
a tarred archive with the configuration
On computer B
Navigate to the USB stick and open a terminal

Install repo packages

sudo pacman -Syu - < repo-pkglist.txt
Install custom packages

pamac build --no-confirm $(cat cust-pkglist.txt)
Extract the files

tar -xzf --overwrite ---directory $HOME dotconf.tar.gz
Caveats
This script does not take into account applications added using flatpak, snap or appimage.

Please consult the applicable man pages on how to list such applications and subsequently add such packages to the new system.

User configuration pertinent to those packages likely exist in either ~/.config and ~/.local but may exist in other locations inside your home.

As far as I can tell, flatpaks are kept in:

~/.local/share/flatpak/
and/or

/var/lib/flatpak
For snaps, it seems in the:

/snap/
