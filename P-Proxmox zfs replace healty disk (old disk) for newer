I think this is the right solution for replacing a healthy (old) hard drive,

always have a look at the serialnummber(s)
Code:

ls -la /dev/disk/by-id

Takes the specified device offline.
Code:

zpool offline rpool /dev/source

shutdown install or replace the disk ( I have no hat-swap and no hot-spare)
only create an empty GPT Partition Table on the new hdd with parted:
Code:

parted /dev/new-disk
(parted)# print
(parted)# mklabel GPT
(parted)# Yes
(parted)# q

there are no additional partitions needed, and I found no reason for replicate the partitions form old disk to the new one.
(afaik this is only needed for a disk in a ZFS-root pool, like descriped in the proxmox wiki)
Only zpool replace is needed:
Code:

zpool replace rpool /dev/source /dev/target

( in this case this command should also work without the source parameter)

If you like to replace perhaps with a larger disk, than you have to set 'autoexpand on' at the first step:
Code:

root@server:~# zpool set autoexpand=on rpool
