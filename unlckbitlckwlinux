    Download and install LiLi on an other Windows machine (Linux Live USB Creator)
    Start LiLi and have it download a lightweight ubuntu image. I chose Xubuntu.
    Install the image to your USB stick.
    Boot the problematic machine with the USB stick
    When you see the ubuntu boot screen, press a key.
    Under F6, set the following options: nomodeset, acpi=off, noacpi and nolacpi
    Boot ubuntu.
    Make a folder /media/windows and /media/mount.
    Download and extract dislocker
    sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev libmbedtls-dev
    change directory to the dislocker/src folder
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    change directory to /usr/bin
    sudo fdisk -l
    identify the partition which is bitlocked. Mine was /dev/sda1.
    sudo dislocker -r -V /dev/sda1 -p315442-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000-000000 -- /media/windows (replace your own bitlocker key and source partition)
    change dir to /media/windows (use sudo -i if you can't access it)
    mount -o loop dislocker-file /media/mount
    You should now see your files in a mounted drive of the file manager.
