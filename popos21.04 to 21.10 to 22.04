While upgrading to Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS from starting with 20.04 LTS, once I got my test machine to 21.10 minor release, when doing the next upgrade, I was hit with “release upgrade aborted: failed to update package lists for the new release.”

Example:
How to Upgrade to Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS & GNOME 42

I re-ran the upgrade button, and the process was executed without any issue.

sudo pop-upgrade release upgrade -f

For users that continue to have issues, you can check the daemon logs to see if anything is noticeable first.

sudo journalctl -u pop-upgrade

A solution could be to stop the pop-upgrade daemon and perform an upgrade if required.

sudo systemctl stop pop-upgrade && sudo pop-upgrade daemon

Once done, start the pop-upgrade daemon service again with the following command.

sudo systemctl start pop-upgrade

Comments and Conclusion

In the tutorial, you have upgraded your existing Pop!_OS 20.04 LTS or minor release Pop!_OS 21.10 to Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS release, which features GNOME 42.

Pop!_OS system requirements mandate a 64-bit processor, plus a minimum of 4GB RAM and 16GB storage. It is designed to use on modern desktops and involves more gaming or high-end application graphical work than a minor resource-light operating system. Overall, this release has stepped the game up again from the team, it is one of the best Ubuntu clones out currently, and the future looks bright compared to some other distributions such as Elementary OS.
