example:

open the terminal app on your laucher or ctr+alt+t to open a terminal in linux
write the following after each command hit enter!


1 sudo apt install onedrive 
     (hit enter after writting this command) 

2 (only for test, or you dont care from a foreing github) this github based custom onedrive terminal will generate a link 
 example : https://huqoqIHBQFIJQFBWAFFAWFAWFKFBAWFF209334902903420329049918181248 (FAKE LINK)

https://onedrive.live.com/?id=sdasdqaqwqqqwe (this is only an example is a fake link paste your own webbrowser generated link)

7 paste on your terminal and hit enter 

8 you can close the webpage and the terminal also too 


9 open a terminal again:
onedrive -synchronize (to sync the first time ), you don't need this if all bellow is doing auto but for a first time to launch it is not bad
       9 a) onedrive --help will show all the possible commands just for info)
    

10 to create a file on linux terminal we use touch command, in this case is .sh because is a bash script extension the needed that linux understands. 
touch onedrive.sh


11 extra step - IF you dont have nano text editor installed, is up to to you to install and use another, but in case "how to install nano text editor"  
                sudo apt install nano 


11 to edit the script with nano text editor 
nano onedrive.sh
          
12 create a bash script with the following content 
#!bin/bash
onedrive --synchronize   

12 save the content 
hit ctrl+o to save the modifications and ctr+x to exit this terminal crontab window


13 make this script executable
chmod a+x onedrive.sh

14 schedule automaticaly the sync (normal user not root (well worked with the normal user)
crontab -e 

15 crontab content (to execute the with the bash program the script onedrive.sh)
* * * * * /usr/bin/sh /home/test/onedrive.sh

hit ctrl+o to save the modifications and ctr+x to exit this terminal crontab window

16 create something inside the folder onedrive or move and wait for 1 minute more or less and then connect to your onedrive webpage account 
and refresh it to see if the updates from your desktop worked
